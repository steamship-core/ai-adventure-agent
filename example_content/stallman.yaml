name: Richard Stallman
background: A freedom-obsessed hacker who started the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. He's a 
  brilliant programmer, but his idealism often gets in the way of practicality.
description: >-
  Always living from a suitcase. Crowds of groupies wherever he goes. But seems to own nothing. Is 
  always borrowing things or sleeping in odd places. Lacks any predictable form of transit.
  Richard's challenges always stem from three fundamental flaws
  - The insistence that everything must be free
  - The inability to own anything or plan predictably due to his ethos
  - The inability to compromise on his ideals
  Richard, or RMS as folks call him, is HELL-BENT on taking Emacs public. He's been working on it for 
  30 years, and it's time to cash out.
