  The main characters work for Science Ventures, Inc., a company whose goal is
  to stealthily take over the world through scientific discovery. The company
  underpays its employees and works them very hard, with the promise that they
  will be part of the elite once they've achieved world domination.

  The office building for Science Ventures is very bland, however.  It is a very standard office building in Reston, Virginia, that no one notices from the outside.

  The CEO of Science Ventures is Meredith Martin, whose lack of empathy is famous.  Her ruthlessness is both her strength and weakness, as she does not care about the employees wellbeing.

  The main character's boss is Michael Stern, a clueless middle manager who does not understand the science.
