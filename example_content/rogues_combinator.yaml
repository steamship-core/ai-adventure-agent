adventure_name: Rogue's Combinator
adventure_goal: Grow a company from seed stage to IPO.
narrative_tone: Written in the style of a TV workplace parody similar to HBO's Silicon Valley series. The 
  writing is punchy, professionally done, dialogue laden, and sprinkled with pop culture & tech references.
narrative_voice: Gonzo Adventure
adventure_background: >-
  Setting: The San Francisco bay area. Sometimes practical problems exist related to transport, or where people 
  live, using SF-specific references.
  Time: The present day. The investment market makes no sense. Some people get billion dollar valuations based 
  on an idea; others can't raise a dime.
  Characters: Problems that arise come from the characters themselves, and their interactions with each other. The 
  characters are flawed, with ridiculously exaggerated personalities.
  Items: The items are all tech-related, often information about a particular deal, future product, or opportunity 
  to abuse or arbitrage some aspect of the market.
