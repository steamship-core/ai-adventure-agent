# Talking to a Trader

If you could actually talk to the trader.

# Traveling Merchant

If two times a week in real life, a traveling merchant came through town.
They'd be a different character, different manner of speaking, they would sell really rare, really expensive stuff.

# Party Members

On quests, you can encounter NPCs. LIike I went into the villiage, and I fought off the dragon.
If you could choose to talk to that person on your quest, and they joined your party.
And they join you in camp.

And then in camp you could TALK TO THEM in camps.
But they could also join you on quests.

# Actual other players of the game could join your party

They could do all the same things an NPC can, but in tandem they go on a quest together.
When you walk into a room and see the goblins, and then the agent waits for EVERY PLAYER TO SAY SOMETHING.
It could be that each player's convo with the agent is private, it could be that it's public... but this is sort of the mechanic that gets you playing.
