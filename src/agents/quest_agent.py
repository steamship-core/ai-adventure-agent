    The quest agent goes on a quest!

    HOW THIS AGENT IS ACTIVATED
    ===========================

    The game log defers to this agent when `game_state.current_quest` is not None.

    The `game_state.current_quest` argument matches `game_state.quests[].name` and is used to provide the
    Quest object to this agent at construction time so that it has a handle on where to load/store state.

    WHAT CAUSES THAT ACTIVATION TO HAPPEN
    =====================================

    The `use_settings.current_quest` string is set to not-None when the following things happen:

    - POST /start_quest (See the quest_mixin)
    - maybe later: The Camp Agent runs the Start Quest Tool

    It can be slotted into as a state machine sub-agent by the overall agent.
