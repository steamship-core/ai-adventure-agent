    - If the story is too long, it takes a prefix of it to avoid going through the token budget.

    - Requires the title and story

    Connections to other generators:

    - Just turns the story into a 2-3 paragraph description and then defers to the generator
      which uses that shorter description as the starting place. This way we have a clean way to
      reuse these generation pipelines in a variety of ways (e.g. generate from a book jacket,
      genereate a plot from Shakeaspeare and then pass it to the description generator)
